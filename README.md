# 1D Finite Element Solver  
### FEM Spatial Discretization + Crank–Nicolson Time Integration

This repository contains a **1D time-dependent numerical solver** implemented in **MATLAB**.  
The solution is obtained using the **Finite Element Method (FEM)** for spatial discretization
(with **P1 and P2 Lagrange elements**) and the **Crank–Nicolson finite-difference scheme**
for time integration.

A **manufactured solution** is included to verify correctness and study convergence,
with errors evaluated in the **\(L^2\)** and **\(H^1\)** norms.
